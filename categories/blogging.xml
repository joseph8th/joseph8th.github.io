Hello, World.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've had many blogs off and on over the years, but I was never satisfied with the blogging platforms I chose, which, admittedly, is not a very large set. OK, it was two: WordPress and Octopress. Octopress at least satisfied my penchant for working in the terminal, and let me use my favorite editor (Emacs, obviously), but I was broke at the time and self-hosting. Eventually, I just let it die off naturally.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now I'm not broke, but I'm still cheap. With GitHub Pages, and Nikola, I can write posts in Emacs Org Mode and publish for free and with ease. Let's see how long it lasts.
